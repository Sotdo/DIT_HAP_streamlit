DNA replication begins when specific sequences, known as origins of replication, are recognized and bound by the origin recognition complex, and ends when the original DNA molecule has been completely duplicated and the copies topologically separated. The unit of replication usually corresponds to the genome of the cell, an organelle, or a virus. The template for replication can either be an existing DNA molecule or RNA." [GOC:mah]

A variety of different DNA repair pathways have been reported that include direct reversal, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, photoreactivation, bypass, double-strand break repair pathway, and mismatch repair pathway."

def: "A biological process is the execution of a genetically-encoded biological module or program. It consists of all the steps required to achieve the specific biological objective of the module. A biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene products (or macromolecular complexes), often in a highly regulated manner and in a particular temporal sequence." [GOC:pdt]
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.

comment: Note that ascospores and asci are separate biological structures. The ascus is the structure that contain the ascospores, but the development of the ascus is a different process than the formation of the ascospores themselves; for instance, some mutations affect sporulation without affecting ascus development. For this reason, GO:0030437 ascospore formation and GO:0075317 ascus development are different terms and are not linked.
